/*behavior.js
* node that manages procedural behaviors and 
renders children according to these behaviors



* default properties: *
anchors : array that keeps track of which objects are refences for the behavior
behaviors: behavior actions that are dynamically added by the user and are distributed to the child nodes
scaffold objects: literal path art that enables user to graphically manipulate the behavior (should be a 1-1 relationship between behaviors and scaffold objects)
